Improved Bronze Wallet Transactions Migration Script

This version properly calculates USD values for NULL records in old schema
and preserves all price fields for downstream PnL processing.

Key improvements:
- Calculates USD values for 6,676 NULL records in old schema (82.4% recovery)
- Preserves all price fields (base_price, quote_price, nearest_price)
- Maintains comprehensive schema for PnL calculations
- Enhanced validation and reporting
